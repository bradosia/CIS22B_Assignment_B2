# Instructions
Repeat problem B1 with the following changes:<BR>
<BR>
Make Cone a class rather than a struct. <BR>
Make the height and radius in the class Cone private. <BR>
Make setUp a public member function in the class Cone. <BR>
Make getVolume a pubic member function in the class Cone. <BR>
Make output a public member function in the class Cone. <BR>
The main and input functions will remain global functions, not part of the Cone class. <BR>
The main function will call the input, setUp, and output functions. <BR>
The return types will all be unchanged. <BR>
The parameter lists will change for some of the functions:

- main unchanged
- input unchanged
- setUp two parameters by value: height, radius
- getVolume no parameters
- output no parameters

Test with the same data.
